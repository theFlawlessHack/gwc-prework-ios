 The QuizController handles the core quiz functionality for this app.
 Setting Questions, Setting/Showing the Next Question, and Showing the Result Controller once all questions have been answered.
 
 This controller is structured by having a qeustions array which is comprised of an array of Question's.
 * Witin the controller class, the Question model is defined* There is a variable to the currentQuestion which is used to refer to the current Question model.
 
 Outlets and Actions are created for the number of answer choices available
 The setQuestion() method updates the view with the current Question model
 The nextQuestion() method, shows the next question if there is another question to show, otherwise
 presents the results controller.
