 The FoodRandomizerController handles the randomizing functionality for this project.
 Setting and randomizing Food Item Images.
 
 This controller is structured by having a list of food items which are the names of the images within the Assests folder.
 The names within the array are randomized and then the returned name is used to create an image.
 This created image is then set as the image for the main image view outlet connection within the storyboard.
